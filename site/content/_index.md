blurb:
  heading: Why S-Scale?
  text: >+
    S scale has a lot to offer the railway modeller looking for something
    different, especially the

    modeller who wishes to experience the Satisfaction of building models from basic materials with just a few ready-made components.


intro:
  heading: What is S?
  text: S scale uses a ratio of 1:64, or 3/16” to one foot. This sounds odd in a
    hobby dominated by millimetres to the foot, but it is incredibly easy to
    work with – an engineer’s steel ruler will have scale inches marked upon it,
    carefully disguised as 1/64 of an inch, and quick calculations can be made
    on the basis that 3” represents 16’ on the model.

    text: For comparison with other scales, the scale is 4.76mm to the foot, which
      makes it 19% bigger than 4mm scale, and 68% of 7mm scale. In practice,
      this might not sound like a big difference, but actually S scale models
      have 69% more volume and mass than 4mm scale, creating a more impressive
      model that also rolls better, yet takes up only half the area of 7mm
      scale.

      S scale layouts will fit into the same space as 4mm scale layouts, but
      with the added bonus of the satisfaction of building it all oneself – plus
      with just a few components to buy, and no RTR it becomes a lot more
      affordable. Two or 3 locos, 3 or 4 coaches and no more than 20 wagons
      provides for a lot of satisfaction for the model builder, and a surprising

      variety of operational activity.

  heading: Take a step away from the norm!
  text: "S Scale is definitely not part of railway modelling’s mainstream and is
    relatively unknown despite the first models dating from the late nineteenth
    century: the very first model was exhibited in 1893. It was live steam, too"
