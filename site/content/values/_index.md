      The first “finescale” model to 1:64 scale was produced by Charles Wynne in 1919: 
      pioneering the concept of getting as close to the prototype as practicalities allow,
      which is still used by members, and 100 years later is the standard way of approaching
       model making to all but non-working museum displays.
